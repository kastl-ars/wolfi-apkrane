# wolfi-apkrane

Container image with [apkrane](https://github.com/jonjohnsonjr/apkrane), based
on [WolfiOS](https://github.com/wolfi-dev/os/) and built using
[melange](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/melange/) and
[apko](https://github.com/chainguard-dev/apko/).

The apkrane package is built in this repository, as there is neither an official
release nor a Wolfi package for apkrane.
